An opinionated lightning-fast approach to building robust web applications using ES2017+ features.

Frankly speaking, I am only a dwarf standing on the shoulders of giants. Namely, these giants are:

- [express-babel by vmasto](https://github.com/vmasto/express-babel)
- [example-node-server by babel](https://github.com/babel/example-node-server)
- [express-generator by expressjs](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)

Supported features

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as the web framework.
- ES2017+ support with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
- Automatic polyfill requires based on environment with [babel-preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env).
- Linting with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/).
- Testing with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).
- Template with [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/getting-started.html)
- Continous integration with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/).
